            <h1> HISTORY OF C</h1>
            <p>In 1972, a great computer scientist Dennis Ritchie created a new programming language called ‘C’ at the
                Bell Laboratories. It was created from ‘ALGOL’, ‘BCPL’ and ‘B’ programming languages. ‘C’ programming
                language contains all the features of these languages and many more additional concepts that make it
                unique from other languages.</p>

              <p> ‘C’ is a powerful programming language which is strongly associated with the UNIX operating system. Even most of the UNIX operating system is coded in ‘C’. Initially ‘C’ programming was limited to the UNIX
                operating system, but as it started spreading around the world, it became commercial, and many compilers
                were released for cross-platform systems.</p>

            <h1> APPLICATIONS OF C</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>The first operating system to be developed using a high-level programming language was UNIX, which
                    was designed in the C programming language. Later on, Microsoft Windows and various Android
                    applications were scripted in C.</li>
                <li>The C programming language is considered an optimum choice when it comes to scripting applications
                    and drivers of embedded systems, as it is closely related to machine hardware.</li>
                <li>GUI stands for Graphical User Interface. Adobe Photoshop, one of the most popularly used photo
                    editors since olden times, was created with the help of C. Later on, Adobe Premiere and Illustrator
                    were also created using C.</li>
                <li>MySQL, again being an open-source project, used in Database Management Systems was written in C/C++
                </li>
